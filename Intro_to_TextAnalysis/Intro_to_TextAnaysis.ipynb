    "We've spent a lot of time in Python dealing with text data, and that's because text data is everywhere. It is the primary form of communication between persons and persons, persons and computers, and computers and computers. The kind of inferential methods that we apply to text data, however, are different from those applied to tabular data. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is partly because documents are typically specified in a way that expresses both structure and content using text (i.e. the document object model).\n",
    "\n",
    "Largely, however, it's because text is difficult to turn into numbers in a way that preserves the information in the document. Today, we'll talk about dominant language models in NLP and the basics of how to implement it in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Part 1: The term-document model\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also sometimes referred to as \"bag-of-words\" by those who don't think very highly of it. The term document model looks at language as individual communicative efforts that contain one or more tokens. The kind and number of the tokens in a document tells you something about what is attempting to be communicated, and the order of those tokens is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the primary method still used for most text analysis, although models utilizing word embeddings are beginning to take hold. We will discuss word embeddings briefly at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, let's import NLTK and load a document from their toy corpus."

Then, some measure of semantic similarity, like the cosine of the angle between unitized versions of the document vectors, is calculated. Finally, distinct topics are identified as leading certain groups of documents. The result is a list of `n` topics with the driving words for that topic, and a list of documents with their relation to each topic (how strongly a document fits that topic.\n",
